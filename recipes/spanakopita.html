        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Spanakopita is one of the only things I currently know how to make and
                my family still says I mess up the recipe.  This dish is a simple to make 
                meal that consists of primarly cheese, spinach and olive oil.

                <li>1 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.</li>
                <li>Drain the spinach thoroughly and squeeze the excess liquid out by hand.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, add the spinach and remaining filling ingredients.  
                    Stir until well-combined.
                </li>
                <li>Unroll the phyllo sheets and place them between two slightly damp kitchen cloths.</li>
                <li>Prepare a 9 1/2" x 13" baking dish by brushing the bottom and sides with olive oil.</li>
                <li>Line the dish with two sheets of phyllo, letting them cover the sides of the dish. Brush with olive oil.
                    Add two more sheets in the same manner, and brush them with olive oil. Repeat until 
                    two-thirds of the phyllo is used up. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    evenly spread the spiniach and feta filling over the crust. Top with two more sheets, 
                    and brush with olive oil.
                </li>
                <li>continue to layer the phyllo sheets, two at a time, brushing with olive 
                    oil until you have used up all the sheets. Brush the very top layer with olive 
                    oil, and sprinkle with just a few drops of water.
                </li>
                <li>bake in the oven for 30 minutes and allow 10 minutes to sit after taking out of the oven.</li>
            </ol>
